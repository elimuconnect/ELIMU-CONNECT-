[`lesson 1: Evaluate: (-8 ÷ 2 + 12 + 9 - 4 + 6) / (56 ÷ 7 + 2)

- Perform operations in the correct order (BODMAS).
- Divide -8 by 2, then add/subtract the rest in the numerator.
- Divide 56 by 7 and add 2 in the denominator.
- Simplify numerator and denominator separately before division.`,

  `A square room is covered by a number of whole rectangular slabs of sides 60 cm by 42 cm. Calculate the least area of the room in square metres.

- Use LCM to find the least side of the square room.
- LCM of 60 and 42 gives the least possible length of one side.
- Square the LCM result to get area in cm², then convert to m² by dividing by 10,000.`,

  `Three bells are rung at intervals of 9 minutes, 15 minutes and 21 minutes respectively. The bells will ring together at 11:00 PM. Find the time the bells had last rung together.

- Find the LCM of 9, 15, and 21 to determine how often the bells ring together.
- Subtract the LCM (in minutes) from 11:00 PM to find the last time they rang together.`,

  `Evaluate: (3/4 + 15/7 ÷ 4/7) of (21/3 × (13/7 - 5/8)) × 2/3

- Start with operations inside brackets.
- Perform divisions and subtractions first.
- Then multiply and apply 'of' as multiplication.
- Follow the correct order of operations throughout.`,

  `Calculate: √(153 × 0.18) / √(0.68 + 0.32)

- Multiply 153 by 0.18 and take the square root of the result.
- Add 0.68 and 0.32, then take the square root of the sum.
- Finally, divide the two square root results.`,

  `Simplify: (x² - 4x) / (x - 4)

- Factor the numerator.
- Cancel any common factors with the denominator.
- Simplify the expression to its lowest terms.`],
